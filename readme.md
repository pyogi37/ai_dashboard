## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following tools installed:

- Node.js (recommended version)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Python (for the AI model simulation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pyogi37/ai_dashboard.git
   cd ai_dashboard

   ```

2. Install the dependencies for both the front-end and back-end:

```cd dashboard_app
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
```

3. Run the front-end and back-end servers simultaneously:

```# From the 'dashboard_app' directory
npm start

# From the 'backend' directory
npm start

```

4. Access the dashboard in your web browser at: http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Upon opening the dashboard, you will see key performance metrics of the AI model.
2. The Data Visualization section presents visualizations of the model's predictions and actual results.
3. You can control the AI model using the "Start Model," "Stop Model," and "Configure Model" buttons.

## Project Structure

The project follows the following directory structure:

ai_dashboard/
├── backend/
